## the Sarcasm SIGN Dataset

This repository contains our data files, containing sarcastic tweet along with their non-sarcastic interpretations,
as created by human experts. The files are available in .txt and .csv formats, and they are built so that each line is comprised of
[sarcastic tweet, non sarcastic interpretation]. Note that every sarcastic tweet appears 5 times with 5 different non sarcastic interpretations.

*"full"* contains the entire corpus (3000 sarcastic tweets with 5 interpretations each, resulting in 15,000 lines). *"Train"* contains 2400 tweets (12,000 lines), *"dev"* and *"test"* contain 300 tweets each (1500 lines).

## Human Expert Instructions
