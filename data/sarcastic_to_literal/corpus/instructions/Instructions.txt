*** Sarcasm Interpretation ***

Dear Fiverr Worker!

Today's task is Sarcasm Interpretation (you can think about it as a kind of paraphrasing).

In the attached excel file there are 1500 sarcastic tweets, all (or most) of them ending with #sarcasm. Your task is to paraphrase the tweet into an honest expression, while keeping the original intention of the author.

Examples:

1) Sarcastic: "This seems safe. #sarcasm"

Possible Honest Interpretations: "This does not seem safe" , "This does not look safe" , "I don't think this is safe" 

2) Sarcastic: "Hey, I was hoping I could get more posts about Donald Trump from unknown websites
on my Facebook timeline. #Sarcasm"

Possible Honest Interpretations:"I don’t want to get anymore posts about Donald Trump on my Facebook timeline." , "Stop showing posts about Trump on my Facebook timeline"

3) Sarcastic: "YAY, Monday. #sarcasm"

Possible Honest Interpretations: "Bummer, Monday." , "I hate that today is Monday".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
REMARKS:

1) Note that there are many correct interpretations! For example in case of example 3: "YAY, Monday. #sarcasm" can be translated into "Bummer, Monday" or "I hate Mondays" or "Mondays are the worst". Just try to keep the author's true intention.

2) If in the tweet there are things that you're unfamiliar with (names of people, events, etc.)
we encourage you to look for that information on google, if you think it will help you provide a better interpretation.

3) You may find that some tweets are not sarcastic in your view, even though they end with #sarcasm. If you encounter such tweets, please let us know and leave the tweet as it is (uninterpreted). 

Do your best and have fun.

If you have any comments or suggestions, I'd love to hear.
Thanks,
Lotem
